# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

This beginner machine learning project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a classic in machine learning and is included with `scikit-learn`. It contains:

- 150 rows
- 4 features:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- 3 target classes:
  - `setosa`
  - `versicolor`
  - `virginica`

---

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- Loading and exploring a dataset
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluating model accuracy using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Predicting species for new data
